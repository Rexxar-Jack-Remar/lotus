# Flow-sensitive inclusion-based pointer analysis

The public headers in `include/Alias/InclusionBased/FlowSensitive/` and the
three analysis implementations use matching variant directories:

| Directory | Analysis | Input | Driver mode |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Sparse/` | `FlowSensitivePTA` | SVFG and MemorySSA | `fspta` |
| `Versioned/` | `VersionedFlowSensitivePTA` | SVFG and object versions | `vfspta` |
| `ValueFlow/` | `ValueFlowPTA` and its `ValueFlowGraph` | LLVM IR | `vfpta` |

Include headers through their variant directory, for example
`Alias/InclusionBased/FlowSensitive/Sparse/FlowSensitivePTA.h`.
The parent `CMakeLists.txt` builds all three variants into the `FlowSensitivePTA`
library used by the alias driver and tests.
The private parallel runtime lives in `Parallel/` and serves the `Sparse/`
public API.

## Parallel execution

```bash
lotus-alias-fspta input.bc --parallel --threads=4 --dump-stats
lotus-alias-fspta input.bc --parallel --threads=4 --verify-parallel
```

`FlowSensitivePTA::Config::parallel` selects a pipeline that evaluates upcoming
transfers on immutable effect snapshots and retires them in the reference
solver's worklist order. Worker blocks forward predicted effects privately;
version and producer checks reject stale predictions. Certified unchanged
effects can be reused without re-running a transfer. Indirect-call connectors
run on the calling thread after evaluators drain.

Use `--parallel-block-size=1`, `--parallel-memo=false`, and
`--parallel-share-sets=false` for ablation experiments. Worker snapshots use
shared immutable sets; selecting hash-consed public storage interns the final
results. The unordered experimental policy (`--parallel-order=unordered`)
can choose a different fixed point on order-sensitive transfers.
Precise memory reads check object contents and entry presence; missing entries
also validate the wildcard namespace. `--parallel-object-certificates=false`
selects whole-channel validation for comparison.

The design, proof assumptions, and current research limitations are recorded
in `docs/research/parallel-flow-sensitive-pta.md` and
`docs/research/parallel-fspta-proof.md` at the repository root.

`FlowSensitivePTA` is the thread-independent sparse solver. It maintains:

- top-level points-to sets for pointer-producing SVFG nodes;
- per-node, per-object MemorySSA `IN` and `OUT` points-to state;
- explicit Addr/Copy/GEP/Phi/Load/Store and parameter-flow transfer;
- canonical `(allocation, normalized byte offset)` field objects, with array
  indices collapsed for field-insensitive updates;
- field-offset-aware aggregate global initializers and `memcpy`/`memmove`;
- singleton-object strong updates and conservative weak updates;
- Tarjan SCC decomposition with SCC-local fixed points and successor requeueing;
- auxiliary-PTA call-graph initialization plus on-the-fly indirect-call
  connection followed by SCC reconstruction;
- selectable mutable and hash-consed points-to set storage.

The concurrency layer does not duplicate this solver. `FSMPTA` runs it over an
SVFG augmented with fork/join and `ThreadMHPIndirectVF` edges. The multi-stage
slicer (MSli) supplies an
optional filtered solve graph.

This module contains three flow-sensitive analyses:

- `FlowSensitivePTA` implements the default exhaustive `fspta` analysis.
- `VersionedFlowSensitivePTA` implements the `vfspta` analysis, which versions
  each abstract object and keys memory facts by that version instead of by
  SVFG location. Its mechanisms are:
  - object prelabeling and meld versions
  - consume/yield maps
  - version and statement reliance
  - strong and weak updates
  - intrinsic memory definitions
  - footprint-equivalent object reuse
  - occurrence-weighted propagation
  - on-the-fly (OTF) delta-edge updates
  - result persistence
- `ValueFlowPTA` implements the value-flow formulation of Li, Cifuentes, and
  Keynes (ESEC/FSE 2011). It builds a field-insensitive value-flow graph
  directly from LLVM IR, orders indirect-flow construction by object escape,
  and applies Algorithm 2's store-plus-IDF sparse reaching-definition solve to
  its interprocedural supergraph. It does not require a precomputed SVFG or
  flow-insensitive pre-analysis.

Select the versioned solver with `lotus-alias-fspta --analysis=vfspta`.
Select the direct value-flow solver with
`lotus-alias-fspta --analysis=vfpta`.
