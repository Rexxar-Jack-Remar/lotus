## 1. Testing Improvements

- Different OS, LLVM, Z3, Boost, etc.
- Use lib/Alias/Dynamic to test pointer analyses.

## 2. Alias Analysis

### Infrastructure

- Specificatin: use lib/Annotation to enable the loading of aliasing specification files for the pointer analyses (And perhpas use dynamic analysis/ML to extract specifications)
- Data structure: integrate different representations of points-to sets.

### Interfaces

Universal interface for the analyses in lib/Alias: 

- Basics: points-to, alias pair, alias set, pointed-by, callgraph, memory dependence, etc.
- Pointer queries: points-to, alias pair, alias set, pointed-by set
- Callgraph: callgraph edges, reachable methods, etc.
- Optimizations: devirtualization, dead code elimination, ...
- Security: bug finding, guided fuzzing, control-flow integrity, code pointer integrity, ...

**Note**: Currently, we may not focus on some "high-level clients" such as taint analysis and memory safety verification, which can require more reasoning capabilities dataflow tracking, numerical analysis, path sensitivity, etc.

We have AliasWrapper.cpp that wraps various alias analyses (to be tested),


### Third-Party

* Integrate the pointer analyses in SVF and DG


## 3. Intermediate Representations (IR) 


### PDG (Program Dependence Graph)

* Use the pointer analysis interfaces (currently, it relies on the memory dependence analysis inside LLVM)

## 5. Numerical Analysis

+ Crab/Lotus concurrent fixpoint performance:
  - Study speculative concurrency for Crab's `concurrenty_fwd_fixpoint_iterator`: allow bounded stale reads inside a WPO SCC, then repair deterministically at loop heads.
  - Use delta-based propagation for abstract states so workers transfer only changed facts, not full domains, across edges.
  - Add instability-aware scheduling for concurrent fixpoint: prioritize hot loop heads, high-fanout nodes, and large abstract-state deltas.
  - Explore a dual-lane design: conservative committed invariants plus speculative worker invariants, with commit only when speculation is safe.
  - Compare against Crab's sequential/interleaved fixpoint and measure speedup, extra rework, convergence iterations, and precision loss (if any).
+ Data structure optimization for abstract domains
  - Better environment maps for abstract interpretation.
    Crab still reflects the classic “Patricia tree as efficient mergeable map” design. A
    serious study comparing Patricia trees, flat_map, B-tree variants, HAMTs, and chunked
    persistent vectors under real analyzer workloads would be valuable. The key metric is
    not only asymptotic merge cost but allocator pressure and cache locality during
    fixpoint iteration.
  - Graph representations for DBM domains.
    Crab already exposes multiple graph backends, which is a sign the choice matters. A
    good research problem is adaptive switching between graph representations based on
    density, update pattern, or SCC phase. Another is incremental closure algorithms that
    exploit workload structure instead of rerunning generic sparse shortest-path
    machinery.

## 6. Dataflow Analysis

**Facilities**

The different engines have many clients that overlap.
We need to extarct some common facilites, e.g., the abstract domains, instead of keeping the independent, ad-hoc implementations under different engines.

**Monontone**
* Revise the monotone dataflow analysis module


**WPDS-based Datafow analysis (lib/Dataflow/WPDS)**

- How to design alias-aware WPDS analyses?
- We use third-party/WPDS for now, but there is an extended, C++ version in third-party/WALi-OpenNWA. Shoud we try to use the new one?
- Code ref.: https://github.com/icra-team/icra (it adds some extensions such as Newtonian Program Analysis?)


## Bindings

- Python (e.g., following https://github.com/SVF-tools/SVF-Python and Z3?)
